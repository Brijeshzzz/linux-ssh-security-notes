# Day 1 – SSH Basics

## What I learned
- SSH is a secure remote access protocol.
- It follows a client-server model.
- Used to manage Linux servers remotely.

## Authentication Methods
- Password-based authentication
- Key-based authentication (recommended)

## Security Perspective
- SSH gives direct system access, so attackers target it.
- Brute force attacks happen when weak passwords are used.

## Questions
- How do SOC teams detect SSH brute force attacks?
